<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoresist for Packaging Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist</li><li>Negative Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photoresists are light-sensitive materials used in semiconductor and packaging applications. Positive photoresists become soluble when exposed to light, allowing the desired pattern to be developed after exposure, making them suitable for fine resolution features. In contrast, negative photoresists harden where exposed to light, becoming insoluble, which allows for robust structures with higher thickness. The choice between positive and negative photoresists depends on the specific requirements of the packaging process, including resolution, feature size, and application environment.</p></p>
